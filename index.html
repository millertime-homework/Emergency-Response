        <h3>Changes in version 1.5 (latest)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            several typo and grammar fixes in the tutorial text, help text, conversation with
            the character James in the earthquake scenario, interactive computer quiz in the
            earthquake scenario.
          </li>

          <li>the mysterious wounded girl is no longer in the hallway before the shooter arrives</li>

          <li>adjusted width of the cell phone popup menu</li>

          <li>
            now when evacuation plan posters are clicked for a given floor, all of the posters
            on that floor are deactivated to reduce some confusion -- "why is this glowing?"
          </li>

          <li>the cell phone's ringer is now enabled each time a new game starts</li>

          <li>the about box on the main menu now displays correctly</li>

          <li>player can no longer inadvertently walk out of the apartment; must click door.</li>

          <b>In the earthquake scenario there are some objectives that I failed and I'm not sure why.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a lot of optional objectives in the earthquake scenario that are only possible before
          the earthquake happens. They don't cause you to get a game over; they are only there for bonus points.
          If you want to play again to try to find them, this is highly encouraged.
          Any objectives that aren't completed - optional or not - are reviewed at the end of this scenario.
          This is done using the objective system.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we didn't use the objective system to track these optional objectives, then there would be no
          "failed objectives" when the optional ones aren't completed. However, this would affect the ending
          sequence that explains which parts were missed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd like to add a feature to the objective system that marks certain objectives as being optional,
          this way they aren't "failed" when they aren't completed. When the objectives are listed at the end,
          they wouldn't be there at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this time, there is no ETA on completing these changes, so unfortunately there will continue to be
          some overly false information at the end of the earthquake scenario.
        </p>

          <b>I am stuck at the smoky hallway.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a frustrating point to reach, and it wasn't extremely clear that the smoke needed to be clicked.
          The smoke can still be clicked, but now you can also click your breathing mask in your backpack (if you
          grabbed it at the beginning) -- or you can pass through unharmed by using the water leaking
          down the wall nearby to wet your shirt.
        </p>

        <p><a name="tutorial"></a>
          <b>The tutorial isn't clear enough and needs more content.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The tutorial does need more content. Here are some items that should show up in the near-to-distant future.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>beginning text needs to be reworded</li>
          <li>ending needs to be less abrupt</li>
          <li>blue glow needs to be pointed out (we put this on all clickable items)</li>
          <li>a character needs to be in the tutorial that the player is told to talk to</li>
          <li>a door needs to be added that the player is told to click to open</li>
          <li>the "Help" button needs to be pointed out and its purpose explained</li>
          <li>the point system needs to be explained</li>
        </ul>

          <b>I'm using Internet Explorer and the game doesn't seem to work right.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have done a lot to resolve incompatibilities in our code with Internet Explorer. There are still
          some existing intermittent issues that aren't fully resolved, and we recommend playing the game
          in <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> or 
          <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p><a name="points"></a>
          <b>The points system doesn't make sense. My score is ridiculous.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The points awarded for the objectives in the game are currently very arbitrary. Sadly no tuning has been
          done to make the points sensical. So sometimes you get a lot of points very easily and sometimes you hardly
          get any.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This is a somewhat large task that needs to be taken on to vastly improve the experience of the game, but
          unfortunately there is no ETA for when it will be completed.
